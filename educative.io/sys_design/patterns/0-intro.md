In the following chapters, we will discuss a set of system design patterns. These patterns refer to common design problems related to distributed systems and their solutions. Knowing these patterns is very important as they can be applied to all types of distributed systems and are very handy, especially in a system design interview.

Here is the list of patterns we will be discussing:

    Bloom Filters
    Consistent Hashing
    Quorum
    Leader and Follower
    Write-ahead Log
    Segmented Log
    High-Water mark
    Lease
    Heartbeat
    Gossip Protocol
    Phi Accrual Failure Detection
    Split-brain
    Fencing
    Checksum
    Vector Clocks
    CAP Theorem
    PACELEC Theorem
    Hinted Handoff
    Read Repair
    Merkle Trees

Letâ€™s get going.
